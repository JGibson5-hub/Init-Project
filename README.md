# init_Project.

This script creates the general folder structure/workflow I use for pulling Tallies from MCNP and putting the data in one folder.
The workflow can be extended to experiments as well.  This workflow:
* Puts details of the model in the filename itself
* Uses the makeTable script to interpret what the filename means
* Process simply generates the table and processes it.  
* There are commented snippets of code in the process file specific to common operations

## getTally.m
